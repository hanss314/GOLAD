# GOLAD
I made this because [carykh](https://www.youtube.com/user/carykh)'s version is iOS only :(

To play the game, [click here](https://github.com/hanss314/GOLAD/archive/master.zip) to download the repository, extract the .zip file, then run the .jar file. (this requires Java 8 to be installed!)
  
Watch [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkGZ2Hl1l8c) video for instructions on how to play and some background. Alternatively, you can play the tutorial provided in the game.

~~Stay tuned for more releases as I update this regularly~~

Ezequiel Keimel made a Javascript version which can be found [here](https://popclom.github.io/GOLAD/)

**This version does not have online play.**

## To Do List

These are features I plan on doing eventuallyâ„¢. You can also suggest new features at the [issues page](https://github.com/hanss314/GOLAD/issues).

- Make hard AI consider opponent moves in calculation

- Von Neumann neighborhoods
