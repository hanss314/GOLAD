# GOLAD
I made this because [carykh](https://www.youtube.com/user/carykh)'s version is iOS only :(

To play the game, [click here](https://github.com/hanss314/GOLAD/raw/master/GOLAD.jar) to download the main jar file.  

## How to Play

Watch these videos for instructions on how to play:
[Video 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8RDs2u92MI) - [Video 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKQJlvqhDzQ)

## Differences

Unlike the version shown in the video, you can not save up moves. To summon a cell, you have to sacrafice two of your own.
This is also reflected in Cary's iOS version

This version does not have online play.
